--Chapter 6 Code - Hive Data Aggregation and Sampling

--Aggregation without GROUP BY columns
SELECT count(*) as rowcnt1, count(1) AS rowcnt2 FROM employee;

--Aggregation with GROUP BY columns
SELECT gender_age.gender, count(*) AS row_cnt FROM employee
GROUP BY gender_age.gender;

--The column age is not in the group by columns, 
--FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10002]: Line 1:15 Invalid column reference 'age'
--SELECT gender_age.age, gender_age.gender, count(*) AS row_cnt
--FROM employee GROUP BY gender_age.gender;

--Multiple aggregate functions are called in the same SELECT
SELECT gender_age.gender, AVG(gender_age.age) AS avg_age,
count(*) AS row_cnt FROM employee GROUP BY gender_age.gender;

--Aggregate functions are used with CASE WHEN 
SELECT sum(CASE WHEN gender_age.gender = 'Male' THEN gender_age.age
ELSE 0 END)/count(CASE WHEN gender_age.gender = 'Male' THEN 1
ELSE NULL END) AS male_age_avg FROM employee;

--Aggregate functions are used with COALESCE and IF 
SELECT
sum(coalesce(gender_age.age,0)) AS age_sum,
sum(if(gender_age.gender = 'Female',gender_age.age,0))
AS female_age_sum FROM employee;

--Nested aggregate functions are not allowed
--FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10128]: Line 1:11 Not yet supported place for UDAF 'count'
--SELECT avg(count(*)) AS row_cnt FROM employee; 

--Aggregate functions cannot apply to null
--SELECT sum(null), avg(null); 

--Aggregation across columns with NULL value.
SELECT max(null), min(null), count(null);
---Prepare a table for testing
CREATE TABLE t (val1 int, val2 int);
INSERT INTO TABLE t VALUES (1, 2),(null,2),(2,3);
----Check the table rows 
SELECT * FROM t;
----The 2nd row (NULL, 2) are ignored when doing sum(val1+val2)
SELECT sum(val1), sum(val1+val2) FROM t;                   
SELECT sum(coalesce(val1,0)), sum(coalesce(val1,0)+val2) FROM t;

--Aggregate functions can be also used with DISTINCT keyword to do aggregation on unique values.
SELECT count(distinct gender_age.gender) AS gender_uni_cnt, count(distinct name) AS name_uni_cnt FROM employee;

--Use max/min struct
SELECT gender_age.gender,
max(struct(gender_age.age, name)).col1 as age,
max(struct(gender_age.age, name)).col2 as name
FROM employee
GROUP BY gender_age.gender;

--Trigger single reducer during the whole processing
SELECT count(distinct gender_age.gender) AS gender_uni_cnt FROM employee;

--Use subquery to select unique value before aggregations for better performance
SELECT count(*) AS gender_uni_cnt FROM (SELECT distinct gender_age.gender FROM employee) a;
